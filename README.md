# Deadlock-detection
The project is about detection of a deadlock in a general resource graph using a designed detection algorithm for reusable resources.

Deadlocks are one of the major problems in concurrent programming. A deadlock happens when some tasks are blocked forever because their requests for resources will never be satisfied. In order to preserve concurrency, we must get deadlocks under control. An algorithm is designed to detect deadlock in an expedient graph and for non-expedient graph, they are converted into expedient graphs.
